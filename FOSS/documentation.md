<h1>FOSS Theme documentation</h1>
This is the documentation for the FOSS theme to be implemented in Drupal 7.<br />

<h2>Home Page</h2>
The home page is consisted of four views, which had been set to show only preview content from nodes of corresponding content types.

<h3>Views and their corresponding content type in paranthesis.</h3>
<strong>Featured Slider (Featured Slider)</strong>- This view is located in the header section
and will cycle through latest images uploaded. <br /><br /> To upload/edit contents and images for Featured 
Slider,one must simply navigate to  the admin navbar and go to<br /> "content/Create content/Featured Slider"
uploading images and edit text. Navigate to "content" and look under column of Featured Slider to view 
all contents of that type and modify.  To add a title and teaser body text just go to drop down choose
full-html and disable rich text. From there add h1 tags for title and p tags for body text. To upload
image simply click on "choose file" under Slider image *note all images uploaded must be 800 x 400 pixels.
Images will automatically be resized when width is scaled down.

<strong>Featured Events (Events)</strong>- This view is located in the content section and is the first of the two sliders. The view basically cycles through all of the lastest nodes in "Events" content type.<br /> To upload/edit new content to be featured on the slider, one would just simply create/edit the node under the content type of  <a href="#Event">event</a>  </li>
		<li></li>
