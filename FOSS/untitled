Page Structure
A page contains the following elements:
SECTIONS (Zone groups)
ZONES (Containers for Regions)
REGIONS (Grid elements, where Blocks display)
Blocks (Containers for content)

Weight comes into play when you view your site in a mobile device (or your browser window is set to a smaller width) and the regions begin stacking vertically. When the regions begin to stack vertically, the region with the least weight will float to the top, while the region with the most weight will sink to the bottom.
